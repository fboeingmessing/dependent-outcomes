# dependent-outcomes
This repository contains the R code used in the empirical applications presented in Florian BÃ¶ing-Messing & Joris Mulder (2021) Bayes Factors for Testing Order Constraints on Variances of Dependent Outcomes, The American Statistician, 75:2, 152-161, https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2020.1715257. The `PIAT.R` and `reading-recognition.R` scripts contain the code for the empirical applications in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the paper, respectively. The `functions.R` script contains helper functions for calculating the Bayes factors and posterior probabilities of the hypotheses.
